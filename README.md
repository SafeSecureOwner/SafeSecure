# SafeSecure
SafeSecure is just like virustotal, but better. SafeSecure scans through any file size, scanning everything, using over 20 different anti-viruses, then averages them all to tell you what is safe and not!
Warning, SafeSecure is not 100% accurate, it may flag anti-viruses due to flaws in it's code, this is not my fault and I am sorry. This is why I reccommend researching into what gets flagged!
